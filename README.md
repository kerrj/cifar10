# cifar10
There are 3 main projects in here:
* Successful classification of the cifar-10 image set using a CNN built in keras
* Unfinished attempt at learning .wav files using LSTMs
* Attempt at recreating YOLO in tensorflow, which I have stopped and am instead using https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow
